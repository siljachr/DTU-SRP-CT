# DTU-SRP-CT
Jupyter Notebooks for SRP CT project days at DTU. 
Use the Core Imaging Library (CIL, https://tomographicimaging.github.io/CIL/nightly/index.html) for specifying and solving CT problems. 

SyntetiskeEksperimenter2024.ipynb: Contains experiments with synthetic data from the Shepp-Logan phantom and illustrates basic reconstruction algorithms. 

RealData_reconstruction2024.ipynb: Can be used as a framework for reconstruction one's own recorded CT data. It is configured so the parameters match DTU's tabletop CT scanners. As an example, a pre-recorded CT scan of a rosehip (hyben) is made available.
